Good news for all business owners, managers and team leaders! 

Kimai has released a major update that makes absence management for teams easier. 

**Now you can easily approve vacation, time off and sick leave in Kimai.**

What's new in the absence approval workflow?

- Automatic approval magic for sickness  
  No more manual clicks - sickness requests are approved automatically.
- Smart absence requests  
  New absences are now automatically set to "requested" status.
- Batch action bliss  
  Pre-approved absences make managing team time off a breeze.
- Clear notifications  
  We've fixed the display of denial and approval notifications.
